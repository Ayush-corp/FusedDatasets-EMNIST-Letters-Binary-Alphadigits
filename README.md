# CPSC585 Group 8 Project - Handwritten Character Recognition

This repository contains the code and documentation for CPSC 585 Group 8's project on handwritten character recognition.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to solve a complex character recognition problem using high-resolution grayscale images of handwritten letters. We explore various deep learning techniques and transfer learning to achieve accurate character recognition.

## Dataset

We use the EMNIST (Extended MNIST) dataset, which includes a broader range of characters beyond the standard MNIST dataset. The dataset comprises handwritten letters in grayscale images.

## Results

### Part 1: Exploring Chollet's MNIST ConvNet

In this section, we examined the accuracy of Chollet's example model using the MNIST dataset. We achieved approximately 98% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

### Part 2: Adapting the Model for EMNIST

We adapted Chollet's MNIST model for the EMNIST dataset, which includes a more extensive character set. After training, our model achieved around 83% accuracy on the EMNIST dataset.

## Usage
